A few minutes with Timothy were enough to confirm that his self-esteem  and general happiness were falling right along with _ . I asked about Timothy's typical day. He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon. He then had a quick snack, followed by either a piano lesson or a lesson with his math tutor. He finished dinner at 7 pm, and then he sat down to do homework for two to three hours. Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.\nWhat if Timothy spent thirteen hours a day at a sewing machine instead of a desk? We would immediately be shocked, because that would be called children being horribly mistreated. Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.\nPlay, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression.\nExperts in the field recommend the minutes children spend on their homework should be no more than ten times the number of their grade level. As a fifthgrader, Timothy should have no more than fifty minutes a day of homework (instead of three times that amount). Having an extra two hours an evening to play, relax, or see a friend would soundly benefit any child's life quality.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat did the writer think of Timothy after learning about his typical day?",

Roman Catholics traditionally wore their wedding band on the right hand, and in many countries and regions in Europe some people still follow this tradition.\nIt is interesting to note that in the long history of the wedding ring that it is only in the last century that men have begun to wear them. However, now both men and women show their love and commitment by exchanging rings on their wedding day.\nOnce you begin shopping for rings you may be amazed by the choices that await you. There are several different types of metals: traditional gold, white gold, platinum, and titanium. You can have an inscription  put on the inside of the band  if you like. Some people are even choosing a tattoo  band. The styles vary from a simple, yet elegant  band to an elaborate  ring covered with jewels. If you do not buy the wedding and engagement rings as a set you will want to be sure the styles are compatible . Choose carefully because this choice will need to stand the test of eternity.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat can we infer from the passage?\n\nChoices:A) Men were looked upon by women for thousands years.\nB) Only women have the right to make themselves beautiful.\nC) women wore rings thousands of years earlier than men.\nD) You can have an inscription put on the inside the band.",

Exactly one of the choices is correct.\n\nPassage:\nUncle Tom gave little Vicki Black a birthday gift one week before her birthday. He told her not to open it until her birthday. She knew her mother wouldn't tolerate any disrespect to the kind man who helped them out after Vicki's father passed away. Besides, Vicki didn't want to get Uncle Tom angry. But little Vicki didn't want to just hold it and guess what was in it. After all, she looked forward to his coming to show her interesting things, like how to turn an old sock into a doll.\nAll the day, Vicki couldn't stop thinking about the gift. While her teacher was giving a lecture, Vicki sat still in her seat, drawing paper dolls inside the box. When school was done, she raced home. Walking into the room, again, she shook the present, but she heard nothing. Holding her breath, she opened the box and looked inside. Seconds later, she cried. When Mrs Black saw the box, she said angrily, \"Didn't I tell you to leave it alone?\"\nVicki sobbed   and said, \"Mommy, you don't understand.\"\n\"Don't cry to me. You have missed everything now, just because you couldn't wait,\" Mrs Black accused. \"What will Uncle Tom think now?\"\n\"Uncle Tom gave me nothing,\" Vicki cried and handed the empty box to her mother. \"He played a trick on me.\"\nMrs Black said doubtfully, \"Uncle Tom is not like that. You must have dropped it.\"\nVicki kept crying. Only a rapid knock on the door made the house quiet. It was Uncle Tom. He looked at the empty box. \"You have already done it? I told you to wait for your birthday.\"\n\"You didn't give me a gift.\" Fresh tears filled her eyes.\n\"I try to give you something. I know your birthday is a special day. I tell myself to give you something valuable to last your whole life. I think hard and get an idea to give you an important lesson. If you open it on birthday, I see you learn. Then I will make a big party to celebrate, Maybe next year you listen, and then you will understand the gift better.\"\nVicki's cheeks flushed  .\n\nQuestion:\nWhat did Uncle Tom want to teach Vicki?\n\nChoices:A) How to respect others\nB) The meaning of gifts\nC) How to deal with gifts\nD) The value of a promise",

By the time I got to the checkout  line, all the supplies I picked out were put out of my hands and placed with things he bought.\nThen there was the time when I took him with me to do some grocery shopping for just a few \" items\". By the time we were finished, my shopping cart was full of groceries from every shelf in the store! My sister and I joke that if you don't want Dad to buy it for you, avoid even mentioning you want something.\n\nQuestion:\nThe authors' two shopping experiences with father show  _  .\n\nChoices:A) father paid little attention to money\nB) father was quick in action\nC) father loved going shopping very much\nD) father paid great attention to his children's needs",

This step was harder than it sounds, because they had to find an engine that was both light-weight and powerful. The engines that they could buy were either too heavy or too weak, so they asked their friend Charlie Taylor to help them build one. The first engine that Charlie built broke almost immediately, but the second one worked well.   \nAfter Orville and Wilbur installed the engine in their plane, they were almost ready. They simply had to wait for the perfect day with just the fight amount of wind. On the morning of December 17, 1903, they had their chance. And the airplane flew into history.\n\nQuestion:\nThe brothers constructed a number of kites in order to  _  .\n\nChoices:A) test the materials they would use for their plane\nB) prove that building a flying machine was possible\nC) see which shape could support the most weight\nD) improve the design of their plane's wings",

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.\nIt's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying\"It got lost\"to\"I lost it\". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.\nMany people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.\nGeorge Bernard Shaw once said,\"People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.\"\"Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,\"said Albert Schweitzer.\nThe following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.\nThe nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.\"It's not my responsibility,\"said the nurse,\"because it's a large puddle  .\"The housekeeper didn't agree.\"Well, it's not mine,\"she said,\"the puddle is too small.\"\nThe angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.\"Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?\"he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.\nSo, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible. Responsible people not only depend on themselves, but show others that they can be depended on.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat can we learn about responsibility?",

The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.\"\"Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,\"said Albert Schweitzer.\nThe following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.\nThe nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.\"It's not my responsibility,\"said the nurse,\"because it's a large puddle  .\"The housekeeper didn't agree.\"Well, it's not mine,\"she said,\"the puddle is too small.\"\nThe angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.\"Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?\"he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.\nSo, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible. Responsible people not only depend on themselves, but show others that they can be depended on.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat can we learn about responsibility?\n\nChoices:A) It's of secondary importance to discipline.\nB) It's the basic but leading quality in one's life.\nC) It has the same requirements for people as discipline.\nD) It's the most important factor in building one's character.",

Exactly one of the choices is correct.\n\nPassage:\nWhether in the home or the workplace, social robots are going to become a lot more common in the next few years. Social robots are about to bring technology to the everyday world in a more humanized way, said Cynthia Breazeal, chief scientist at the robot company Jibo.\nWhile household robots today do the normal housework, social robots will be much more like companions than mere tools. For example, these robots will be able to distinguish when someone is happy or sad. This allows them to respond more appropriately to the user.\nThe Jibo robot, arranged to ship later this year, is designed to be a personalized assistant. You can talk to the robot, ask it questions, and make requests for it to perform different tasks. The robot doesn't just deliver general answers to questions; it responds based on what it learns about each individual in the household. It can do things such as reminding an elderly family member to take medicine or taking family photos.\nSocial robots are not just finding their way into the home. They have potential applications in everything from education to health care and are already finding their way into some of these spaces.\nFellow Robots is one company bringing social robots to the market.

I felt like I was a somebody who had become a nobody. \n   I was 18 and had just graduated from high school, when my mum told me, \"You can't just depend on skating to make a living. You'd better find a job.\" I knew she was right. So I found a job at a restaurant where I waited at tables and did anything else that needed to be done. In fact, I worked so hard that I had never got the chance to have a break. No one cared that I had been an Olympic skater; I was judged only by how hard I worked. \n   That job taught me so many things. I learned, for example, how to deal with people. As an athlete, this was new to me. One day a man loudly called me over to his table and complained, \"This milk is sour. I am not drinking this junk! I want my money back! \" It was near the end of my shift   and I wanted to tell him how rude I thought he was. But I had learned that \"the customer is always right\" and a smile can go a long way. \"I'm really sorry, sir. I'll get you a free cup.\" I said with a smile. When I brought him his coffee, his attitude changed. And he left me a tip! \n   My first job taught me that it is important to do your best at anything you try. I knew nothing about being a waitress when 1 started my job but by the time I left when 1 decided to return to skating -- I had earned a raise and my boss's praise.

The entire content of your response should be of the following format: 'ANSWER: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of A,B,C,D.\n\nYou are provided with a passage, a question based on the passage, and four choices for the answer. Exactly one of the choices is correct.\n\nPassage:\nThe preventive measures for forest fires include some preemptive methods that can help reduce the risks of fires and control their severity and spread,and thus, maintain ecological balance and protect resources.Close monitoring of forest fires caused by natural factors can help prevent their spread to a large extent.To contain forest fires,fire departments usually use water and chemical fire retardants that can be dropped from planes and helicopters.To control the spread of a wildfire.firefighters usually create a control line by removing all fuel from an area so that the fire cannot travel across it.\nControlled burns are often employed by government authorities to reduce fuel buildup,and clean up the fallen leaves,and thus,prevent the spread of forest fires to a vast area.Regular controlled burns can also help maintain biodiversity ,as the smoke and heat produced in the process can facilitate the growth of seeds of certain plant species.Apart from these,responsible human behavior can help reduce the number of forest fires to a great extent.In fact,we can reduce the number of wildfires dramatically by not leaving behind any source of fire in the forest.\nForest fires can affect climate and weather to a great extent,besides causing severe damage to valuable trees.Wildfires can increase the level of greenhouse gases(water vapor, carbon dioxide,etc),and therefore increase pollution and global warming.However, they are also an important part of the ecosystem,and many plants depend on the heat and smoke generated by wildfires for their growth and reproduction.But large wildfires can cause extensive damage to the ecosystem,which again highlights the importance of effective control and prevention of forest fires*\n\nQuestion:\nA controlled forest fire may play a positive role because   _  .\n\nChoices:A) a new forest will appear soon\nB) it promotes the development of some seeds\nC) nature keeps its balance only by wildfires\nD) it makes the trees grow faster than before",

The pad is more modern, but the wooden stand is surely the original one.\n    \"I'm just amazed you still have the same stand for holding the pad and pencil after all these years.\" I say to her, \"Can't you afford a new one?\"\n    My mother replies ,\"It works perfectly well.I've always kept the stand in the kitchen.I never knew when I might want to note down an idea, and I was always in the kitchen in those days.\"\nShe smiles and says, \"One day I was cooking and watching baby Pauline, and I had a great thought, but the stand was empty.One of the children must have taken the paper.So I just picked up the breadboard  and wrote it all down on the back.The idea turned out to be really helpful in solving the mathematical problem I was working on.\"\nThis story--which happened before I was born--reminds me how special my mother was, and is, as a gifted mathematician.I feel ashamed that I complain  about not having enough child-free time to work.Later, when my mother is in the bathroom, I go into her kitchen and turn over the breadboards.Sure enough, on the back of the smallest one, are some penciled marks I recognize as mathematics.Those marks have travelled through fifty years, rooted in a cheap wooden breadboard, exhibits at every meal.\n\nQuestion:\nIn the author's mind, her mother is   _\n\nChoices:A) strange in behaviour\nB) fond of collecting old things\nC) devoted to her research\nD) careless of her children",

I pull back the curtains and the sky is dark grey. \nHearing my brother is getting up, I go downstairs to make him a cup of tea. He's down in the kitchen about five minutes later, wearing his work clothes, eyes mostly closed against the morning. \n\"Morning.\" I say. \n\"Uh huh.\" \nI leave him to work out what he is going to eat and go back to my room, and get back beneath the quilt . \nThis morning I want to think a while. Today is Dad's birthday; Mom won't mention it. My brother might, just to _ , so I'll keep him sweet when he comes in from work. Every year on my dad's birthday I draw a picture of him; each year he looks a bit different. I'm an artist. It's not that I draw a straighter line or a truer circle, as they try to teach us to do at school. I just get the message across more clearly than other people. More truthfully. I know it.\nI read a lot of books too, mainly about artists, and I try to paint like them. When my dad comes back I'll be able to say \"this is you when I was twelve and I was in love with Monet\" or \"this is you on your thirty-eighth birthday, when I was fourteen, and you'd been gone five years, and I wanted to paint like Dante Gabriel Rossetti.\" And he'll look at each painting and know that I love him and never forget him. \nOn Saturday mornings he'd take me to town and I'd drag him around the art shops. On my sixth birthday he bought me a box of 99 crayons. On my eighth birthday he bought me an easel  , a real one, not a kiddie's. On my ninth birthday he bought me oils. Some mornings I'd wake up and there'd be a book on my pillow about Picasso, or Chagall.\n\"Draw me,\" he'd say. \n\"Aw, Dad, I can't.\"\nI know I should go to school; I'm not one of those kids who are scared to go. But, it's my dad's birthday and I think I must spend it with him. \nSo I spend some time thinking about his hair, which I think is probably no more grey than it was last year; I know hair doesn't age at the same speed every year, but I make his hair longer this year. And in my mind's eye I give him an extra few pounds too. But I keep the smile fixed in my head, like it is when he's happy. \nIt's head and shoulders, so I'll put him in a T-shirt that shows his neck and throat and how strong he is and how brightly his eyes shine and how his eyebrows are dead level straight and still black. \nI try to think of how much I want to show and how much I want to tell. \nThen I pick up a charcoal stick  and do it. I pick up a chalk to add a suggestion of color1 to his eyes, then another chalk for his mouth. \nAnd there he is. \nDad. \nThere  _ are.\n\nQuestion:\nWe can infer from the article that the author is   _   her father.",

Researchers from the University of Plymouth in England doubted whether mood might affect the way kids learn. To find out the answer, they did two experiments with children.\nThe first experiment tested 30 kids. Someshapes  were hidden inside a different, larger picture. The kids had to find the small shapes while sitting in a room with either cheerful or sad music playing in the background. To test their mood, the scientists asked the kids to point to one of five faces, from happy to sad. Children who listened to cheerful music tended to point to the smiley faces while the others pointed to the unhappy ones. The researchers found that sad kids took at least a second less to find the small shapes. They also found an average of three or four more shapes.\nIn the second experiment, 61 children watched one of two scenes from a film. One scene was happy, and the other was sad. Just like in the first experiment, kids who saw the sad scene acted better compared to the others.\nThe researchers guessed that feeling down makes people more likely to focus on a problem or difficult situation.

Exactly one of the choices is correct.\n\nPassage:\nThere are three different kinds of friends in our life. I classify   them according to how well I know them and how well they know me.\nThe first type of friend is just an acquaintance  .This means that you only know their name. You might not even remember what they look like if you go away for a short vacation. You don't miss them when they are elsewhere. It is also this type of friend who gives you the most amount of aggravation  .Since most of the time you are placed in a position where you have to act friendly. You would not normally tell an acquaintance when he or she is doing something that makes you feel angry,such as tapping the fingers on a table or shouting loudly. I call them \"pest friends\".\nThe second kind of friend is a \"guest friend\".They are just social partners. You meet them at a certain location and at the end of the meeting you go your separate way and they go theirs. You don't talk too often with this sort of friend,and you don't share each other's secrets.\nLastly,we have  \"best friends\".This sort of friend is there when you need them. They know you as a person and they are there through thick and thin. Best friends are the ones that you can lean and depend on no matter what happens. If you need a listening ear,they will be the one to lend support.\nFriends come in all different shapes and sizes. Every friend has an influence on our life....\n\nQuestion:\nAccording to the writer,when a friend of the first type acts in an annoying way,you   _  .\n\nChoices:A) can tell him/her about it directly\nB) should stay away from him/her\nC) should advise him/her to correct his/her behavior\nD) may find it hard to tell him/her not to do so",

Exactly one of the choices is correct.\n\nPassage:\nA nine-year-old kid was sitting at his desk when suddenly there was a puddle   between his feet and the front of his trousers was wet. He thought his heart was going to stop because he couldn't possibly imagine how this had happened. It had never happened before, and he knew that when the boys found out, especially Jack, _ When the girls found out, especially Martha and Jackie, they would never speak to him again as long as he lived.\nHe prayed this prayer, \"Dear God, I need help now! Five minutes from now I'm dead meat!\" He looked up from his prayer and here came the teacher with a look in her eyes that said he had been discovered. As the teacher was walking toward him, a classmate named Susie was carrying a goldfish bowl full of water. Susie lost her balance in front of the teacher and dumped   the bowl of water in the boy's lap. The boy pretended to be angry, but all the while was saying to himself, \"Thank you, Lord!\"\nNow all of a sudden, instead of being the object of ridicule  , the boy was the object of sympathy  . The teacher rushed him downstairs and gave him gym shorts to put on while his trousers dried out. All the other children were on their hands and knees cleaning up around his desk. Martha even gave him her own candy. The sympathy was wonderful. But as life would have it, the ridicule that should have been his had been turned to someone else--Susie. She tried to help, but they told her to get out.\nWhen school was over, the boy walked over to Susie and whispered, \"You did that on purpose, didn't you?\" Susie whispered back, \"I wet my trousers once, too!\"\n\nQuestion:\nBesides Susie,   _   also knows what had really happened to the boy.\n\nChoices:A) Martha\nB) Jack\nC) the teacher\nD) the boys",

A thick layer of dark green rock, which is usually found deep inside the planet, lies exposed.\nThe crust, mantle  and core  are the main layers that make up the planet. The mantle rests between the crust and the core.\nLast month, a team of 12 British scientists set off on a six-week trip to study the hole in the crust.\nThe hole is about 4,800 meters below sea level and is believed to be more than 48,000 meters long and more than 48,000 meters wide. Scientists think that there are other nearby gaps. \"It is like a window into the interior   of the Earth,\" says scientist   Bramley Murton, who is part of the research team.\nThe site where the hole is located is part of a ridge   of undersea volcanoes.  There, two of the plates that make up the Earth's surface meet. The plates are always   moving. When the plates move away from each other, lava rushes up from the mantle to   fill the gap and form a new crust. But this did not happen in the area where the hole is located.\nThe hole is giving researchers a good opportunity to study what's below the Earth's   surface. The team will use a special robotic tool to film the area and get samples of the exposed mantle. They hope to study everything from the chemistry of the oceans to how the Earth's surface behaves under the sea.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat's the title for the passage?",

The mantle rests between the crust and the core.\nLast month, a team of 12 British scientists set off on a six-week trip to study the hole in the crust.\nThe hole is about 4,800 meters below sea level and is believed to be more than 48,000 meters long and more than 48,000 meters wide. Scientists think that there are other nearby gaps. \"It is like a window into the interior   of the Earth,\" says scientist   Bramley Murton, who is part of the research team.\nThe site where the hole is located is part of a ridge   of undersea volcanoes.  There, two of the plates that make up the Earth's surface meet. The plates are always   moving. When the plates move away from each other, lava rushes up from the mantle to   fill the gap and form a new crust. But this did not happen in the area where the hole is located.\nThe hole is giving researchers a good opportunity to study what's below the Earth's   surface. The team will use a special robotic tool to film the area and get samples of the exposed mantle. They hope to study everything from the chemistry of the oceans to how the Earth's surface behaves under the sea.\n\nQuestion:\nFor the main layers of the earth, which one is right?\n\nChoices:A) crust, mantle, core\nB) seabed, crust, mantle\nC) seabed, mantle, core\nD) crust, seabed, core",

And I don't think I'll be ready to settle down and stay in one place.\n    So this is probably the generation gap that divides my friends and me from our parents.

We'd rather spend our money on travel than put it in a savings account.\n    This casual attitude toward responsibility has caused some critics to call my generation \"arrogant\", \"impatient\", and \"overprotected\".

My parents told me that there were no presents because Santa was very angry with my behavior over the past year. The next year on Christmas Eve I slept downstairs with a plastic sword waiting for Santa to make sure that he didn't steal the new TV. The next morning, when I woke up, I saw Santa standing there. As soon as I saw that there were no presents, I grabbed my plastic sword and ran at him, shouting angrily: \"THIEF! THIEF!\"\nJack\nWhen I was young, we always had a specific room for the Christmas tree. My mom never really liked the location, so one year she moved the tree into another room. I was convinced that Santa would not know where the tree was and would get lost in our house. I was worried that he would be mad and put me on the \"bad\" list and would not give me any gifts because he couldn't find the tree. I came up with the idea to make signs leading from the fireplace to the tree. They said things like: \"Tree this way\" or \"Santa, put the gifts over here.\" When my big brother saw them he began to laugh his head off.\nLucy\nDoes everyone remember going to the mall and sitting on Santa's lap to have his picture taken at Christmas time?\nWell, I used to think that if I did that, Santa would get mad bcause he would have to go all around the world and give every kid the chance to have his picture taken with him. Of course his lap would hurt and he would be very fired. I thought he might keep a copy of the picture and that would be how he decided who would be on his naughty list.\nMy mom couldn't get me onto Santa's lap until she made him promise I wouldn't end up on his naughty list.\nLydia\n\nQuestion:\nThe real reason why Jack's TV was taken away is that   _  .",

Exactly one of the choices is correct.\n\nPassage:\nOne year, my school report made my parents angry. On Christmas Eve, all the presents were stolen, along with our TV. My parents told me that there were no presents because Santa was very angry with my behavior over the past year. The next year on Christmas Eve I slept downstairs with a plastic sword waiting for Santa to make sure that he didn't steal the new TV. The next morning, when I woke up, I saw Santa standing there. As soon as I saw that there were no presents, I grabbed my plastic sword and ran at him, shouting angrily: \"THIEF! THIEF!\"\nJack\nWhen I was young, we always had a specific room for the Christmas tree. My mom never really liked the location, so one year she moved the tree into another room. I was convinced that Santa would not know where the tree was and would get lost in our house. I was worried that he would be mad and put me on the \"bad\" list and would not give me any gifts because he couldn't find the tree. I came up with the idea to make signs leading from the fireplace to the tree.

Of course his lap would hurt and he would be very fired. I thought he might keep a copy of the picture and that would be how he decided who would be on his naughty list.\nMy mom couldn't get me onto Santa's lap until she made him promise I wouldn't end up on his naughty list.\nLydia\n\nQuestion:\nThe real reason why Jack's TV was taken away is that   _  .\n\nChoices:A) his parents were too careless\nB) his parents thought he had watched too much TV\nC) Santa Claus was not satisfied with Jack's behavior\nD) Santa gave the TV to another child as a present",

As an English-speaking country, you won't be faced with any language barriers.

Well known for being very cheap, especially in the north. A good choice if you want to get away on a budget. Thailand has a lot to offer, from the party-central Bangkok to beautiful beaches and tropical   jungle.\nHong Kong, China\nHong Kong is a great place to relax for solo travelers as it is full of \"Zen moments,\" such as beautiful gardens and Tai Chi classes.\nWhy it's a great choice: Hong Kong is regarded as one of the safest cities in the world. If you're not well-traveled, or perhaps a bit tired of things like language barriers, Hong Kong is a great place to start, as it mixes both Eastern and Western at the same time.\nBali, Indonesia\nBali is a spiritual place with yoga, spas, healthy food and beaches. The combination of friendly people and splendidly visual culture has made Bali Indonesia number one tourist attraction.\nWhy it's so great: You won't be the only solo traveler in Bali. Everyone is known for being extremely friendly and you're sure to meet some amazing characters along the way. As a Hindu island, Bali is the perfect place for a relaxing and spiritual retreat  .

My father and I were at a grocery store, and I asked, \"What are all the flags doing here?\" He said, \"We are having the Olympic Games. That's where they honor the greatest athletes in the world.\" I said, \"Papa, someday I'm going to be an Olympic champ.\"\nWalking up the 10-meter platform, I thought to myself, \"I've waited 16 years for this moment. Am I going to win?\" So I prayed to God that I was most deserving of winning the Games.\nDAVID BOND, 90, BRITAIN\nGOLD, SAILING\nDuring the war, I spent six years in Royal Air Force. I think in general, the 1948 Olympics meant very little to most people. We were too busy after the war to be worried about sport very much anyway.\nOur team had about six weeks before the Olympics down at Torquay and we went out sailing every day.\nWinning gold was quite something. It was nice to stand on the platform with lots of people cheering. We celebrated by going to a big dance.\nMICHAEL LAPAGE, 88, BRITAIN\nSILVER, ROWING\nI started rowing when I was 14. I joined the navy in 1942. In 1945 the war came to an end and I started rowing again.\nIn 1948 we were still on rations  : 4 oz. of red meat a week. But the United States had all the meat they wanted. They were the favorites to win.\nOn the day of the final, we led the Americans at the start, but their stronger staying power took them through to win. There were no ribbons on the medals, so we just showed them round the family.\nTHOMAS GODWIN, 91, BRITAIN\nBRONZE, CYCLING\nAt 14 I left school and got a job delivering groceries on a bicycle, which excited my interest in cycling. When the war broke out, I volunteered but was held back, so I continued riding.\nAfter my team won our bronze medals, we went home just round the corner and had a sit-down and a chat and a laugh.

Take the entire minute--but only one minute--to do nothing else but feel that emotion.\nWhen the minute is over, ask yourself, \"Am I willing to keep holding on to this negative emotion as I go through the rest of the day?\"\nOnce you've allowed yourself to be totally immersed in the emotion and really feel it, you will be surprised to find that the emotion clears rather quickly.\nIf you feel you need to hold on to the emotion for a little longer, that is OK. Allow yourself another minute to feel the emotion.\nWhen you feel you've had enough of the emotion, ask yourself if you're willing to carry that negativity with you for the rest of the day. If not, take a deep breath. As you exhale, release all that negativity with your breath.\nThis exercise seems simple--almost too simple. But, it is very effective. By allowing that negative emotion the space to be truly felt, you are dealing with the emotion rather than stuffing it down and trying not to feel it. You are actually taking away the power of the emotion by giving it the space and attention it needs. When you immerse yourself in the emotion, and realize that it is only emotion, it loses its control. You can clear your head and proceed with your task.\n\nQuestion:\nThe author's opinion towards negative emotion is   _  .",

The entire week is \"Take Your Pet to Work Week\" so there's no need to go to the office without your furry or even feathered (if your pet is a bird) friend.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich is one of the advantages dogs have according to the passage?\n\nChoices:A) They lower people's blood pressure.\nB) They keep company with people.\nC) They save people's money.\nD) They lead people to their work.",

Exactly one of the choices is correct.\n\nPassage:\nHave you thought about what determines the way we are as we grow up? Remember the TV program Seven Up ? It started following the lives of a group of children in 1963. We first meet them as wide-eyed seven-year-olds and then catch up with them at seven-year intervals ( )  : nervous  14-year-olds , serious  21-year-olds , then  grown-ups.\n     Some of the stories are inspiring ,others sad ,but what is interesting in almost all the cases is the  way  in which  the  children's early hopes and dreams are  shown  in their future lives, for example ,at seven ,Tony is a lively child who says he wants to become a sportsman or a taxi driver. When he grows up, he goes on to do both.  How about Nicki ,who says, \"I'd like to find out about the moon. \" and goes on to become a space scientist.  As a child, soft - spoken Bruce says he wants to help \"poor children\" and ends up teaching in India.\n      But if the lives of all the children had followed this pattern, the program would be far less interesting than it actually was. It was the children whose childhood did not prepare them for what was to come that made the program so inspiring. Where did their ideas come from about what they wanted to do when they grew up? Are children influenced by what their parents do ,by what they see on television ,or by what their teachers say? How great is the effect of a single important event? Many film directors ,including Stephen Spielberg ,say that an early visit to the cinema was the turning point in their lives.  Dr. Magaret  Mc Allister ,who has done a lot of research in this area ,thinks that the major influences are parents , friends and the wider society.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat does the writer think of the TV program?\n\nChoices:A) Interesting.\nB) Crazy.\nC) Dull.\nD) Serious.",

Blame! Blame!\nIt seems natural to sing this self-pitying song,but the truth is,if you don't like your life,you should do something about it.No one else knows exactly how you feel or what you need.No one can read your mind correctly.You are the only one with the power to cheek your life,and if you want it to be different,you can change what you're doing.\nWhen you're in trouble,don't give away your power to decide how you feel about yourself. Choose how you want to think and act.Other people can't make you unhappy or angry.They only act in their own way and then it's up to you to decide how you will respond .For example,your friends go out to lunch without you and you feel very angry.How are you going to act? You may blame your friends,\"They are not kind.Who needs them anyway?\" Or you may tell your friends how you feel,listen to their explanation,and let them know you'd like to be invited next time.\nWhen you decide everything in your own way,you're getting hold of your own life and shaping it according to your tastes and feelings.You can choose to be happy,to make friends and to build an interesting life.When you blame others for what is or isn't happening in your life,you have stopped growing or learning.\nOne of the most important rules is that you can never change another person by your direct action.The only person you have the right to change is yourself.Once you change,the other person has something different to respond to and change is possible.If you want change in your life,begin with yourself.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat's the writer's idea about how to change others?\n\nChoices:A) He thinks it's impossible to change others.\nB) He believes our love can change everything.\nC) He chooses to talk with others directly.\nD) He prefers to change ourselves first instead.",

Exactly one of the choices is correct.\n\nPassage:\nSome time ago,I was diagnosed with breast cancer and reacted in the way most people would.The first thing came to mind was a \"death sentence\".  However,I found out later it was truly \"an awakening\" for me,especially after being diagnosed with colon cancer a few years later,but still alive to tell about them both.I began to question God.Why was I chosen to suffer this double challenge?What had I done in life so bad to have this placed upon me?I was unhappy with the way I look and the intolerant pain I had to experience each day,but instead of sighing over my fate,I decided to look on the positive sides of it.\nI knew that I was about to face a new beginning,new hope,do and see more with a whole new perspective on life.I also began thinking of the individuals that are no longer among us and how there will always be someone worse off than I am.Who am I to complain?I still have my life.\nDuring my treatments,I experienced something of a miracle that I had to write down.I took that experience and turned it into a poem and I called it \"Peace\".I took that poem along with many others I had composed during my breast cancer period and submitted them for publication.The book of poems was accepted and published under the title \"True Simple Poems of Life,Faith and Survival\".\nI continue to write and hope that my poetry may encourage other unfortunate people and my writing continues to give me strength.I've had another inspirational children's book published called \"If Only I Could Fly,Said Mattiebee\".\nI would never have become a writer,producing inspirational stories,if I had not gone through all that I did.I'm a true example that you can survive cancer,not once,but twice,providing that you catch it in time.It won't all be easy,but you must have faith and allow that faith to direct your path.\nI truly believe when you survive a terrible tragedy or a horrible disease like cancer,it's for a reason--you have a purpose,and I want to live and find out exactly what that is for me.\n\nQuestion:\nWe can know from the passage that   _  .\n\nChoices:A) the author developed breast cancer a few years after colon cancer\nB) writing only helped the author alone\nC) the author wrote stories as well as poems\nD) If Only I Could Fly,Said Mattiebee is a poem",

But at other times he spent hours before the picture, lost in contemplation, examining, comparing, and measuring his figures.\nThis inactivity aroused the anger of the fussy Prior, the head of the church, who belonged to the large group of those who believed that the busier a man seems, the more he accomplishes; and so he tried to find fault with the idle  painter. Leonardo was slightly unhappy and explained to somebody else that there is a great difference between the work of the creative artist and the stonemason . The creative artist needs time for contemplation; he may be busiest when his hands are idlest. Just now he needed two heads to complete the picture: that of Christ, for which no model on earth could be found, for where was the man to be found whose face would express the strength, and beauty, and tenderness, and deep sorrow of the Christ; then he also needed a head of Judas, and that was hard to find as well, for where was the man whose face could express the meanness of that base traitor . But he would look no further; if none came his way, he would be satisfied to take Prior as a model for Judas. This threat silenced the angry Prior, who quite naturally had no desire to pass to descendants in such a fashion.\n\nQuestion:\nWhy did the Prior complain about the delay?",

Exactly one of the choices is correct.\n\nPassage:\nOne evening I went out and left my 17-year-old son in charge of his 8-year-old brother and 4-year-old sister.On this occasion, the work was made less troublesome by the presence of his girlfriend.I left with complete confidence that the older children would do a wonderful job of babysitting the younger children.Later, I discovered that complete confidence was the last thing I should have left home with.\nI had decided to return home earlier than planned so that my son and his girlfriend could go out.I called home with this happy news.But instead of hearing his cheerful, grateful voice on the other end of the line, all I heard was the sound of a telephone ringing.\nIt was, I should point out, after 10 p.m.,when the two younger children should have been in bed, and when the two older children should have been answering the phone.\"I'll give him a lesson,\" I said. I decided they must be outside.Why they might be outside at 10:30 on a winter night I had no idea, but it was the only explanation I could come up with.\nFinally, in desperation, I called his girlfriend's house. After what seemed like countless rings, his girlfriend answered.\"Yes,\" she said brightly, \"He's right here.\"\nHe came on the phone.I was not my usual calm, rational self. After all, one of the rules of survival for modern parents is that you can't trust modern teenagers.\"Where are the children?\" I said.He said they were with him.They had done nothing wrong.My son had taken the younger children over to his girlfriend's house just for ice cream and cake.This was too good to be believed. Well, it turns out that I shouldn't have believed it.It was only part of the truth.\nThe following Saturday evening we were at my parents' home, celebrating my birthday.My oldest son gave me the children's gifts.Mounted and framed were a series of lovely color photographs of my children, dressed in their best clothes, and wearing their most wonderful expressions.They are pictures to treasure a lifetime, all taken by the father of my son's girlfriend.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat does the author intend to tell us by the story?\n\nChoices:A) Modern teenagers are not worth trusting.\nB) It is no easy job to look after young children.\nC) It's no good to have a girlfriend at an early age.\nD) Her children have a caring and tender heart.",

He has nimble fingers and has trained himself in running. Generally, he carries a newspaper or magazine in his hand. He may appear fairly clever and pretend to be calm.

He carefully remembers the payday and bonus times of companies.\n              Pickpocketing and stealing from a shop together represent about 75% of daytime little crimes in America.

Exactly one of the choices is correct.\n\nPassage:\nThe majority of physicists once believed that the universe's expansion was slowing down. In 1998, they were proven completely wrong. Though it flies in the face of scientific theory, the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate. \nOne possible explanation is that empty space has a thing called dark energy, which supposedly makes up about three quarters of the universe. Dark energy supposedly very sparsely  exists in such a way that it interacts with other objects only through attracting force. It has a strong negative pressure, which causes it to pull on its surroundings and as a result, pull apart the universe. This neatly explains the universe's expansion without completely changing our understanding of the universe.

I thought that something big was up, and they were waiting for me to be part of it. Just then one of my co-workers Susan stepped forward, and I realized I was not just part of it...  _ !\nHappy tears filled my eyes as Susan told me she'd celebrated an early Christmas Eve with her daughter so that I could have the shift off and go home to be with my parents. Maggie had taken Susan's shift, and two more had split Maggie's shift.\nGrateful tears froze to my cheek as I reached my car. There was hardly any traffic as I sped home. I sang along to the carols on the radio, alone on the highway. But I was not alone in my heart, for it was filled with thanks and wonder.\nMy co-workers had given me the greatest Christmas gift I'd ever received--their friendship and understanding. Because of that gift, and the sweet memories of that night, I will never be alone on Christmas again.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat would be the best title for the test?\n\nChoices:A) A Night Shift on Christmas.\nB) A Christmas with My Patents.\nC) The Gift of Understanding.\nD) The Fun of Working Holidays.",

When the bottle got to me, I thought:\"What should I do?\"I took a swig. It was the biggest mistake of my life. I had to drive home later that night.\nI went back to my car, got in and drove off. At a stop sign I saw a policeman sitting in the parking lot across the street. His headlights were turned on, and I knew he was going to follow me. Then he flashed his lights at me. All I could think was: \"Oh no, that swig!\"\nI pulled over and waited for him to come to my door. It felt like forever. \"Can I see your license and registration, please, Miss?\" I gave them to him. He took them and went back to his car for a while. When he returned, he asked if I had been drinking.\n\"No,\" I said. He asked me to step out of my car.\n\"Walk heel to toe down the white line, please.\" I passed the test. Next he had me stand on my left foot, lift my right foot and hold it for 30 seconds. I'm not the most coordinated   person and I can't even walk and chew gum at the same time, so, needless to say, I didn't pass. Then he asked me to take a breathalyzer test.\nThat was where I messed up. I told him I didn't want to and didn't understand why I had to. The officer asked me three more times, and I continued to refuse. He told me to turn around and place my hands behind my back. He arrested me right then and there.\nThe policeman drove me to a police station 20 minutes from my home. He called my parents and told them where I was.\nI went to court two months after that, charged with refusing to obey an officer. I got a $700 (4,340 yuan) fine and 40 hours of community service. I'll be on probation   for a year, and I'll have to take the driving test again. I lost my license for a whole year.\nThis was a huge learning experience for me.

Albert Einstein was unable to get a job as a physics professor. He could have said to himself, \"Well, I just don't have the work relative to physics. I should give up on it and settle for something else.\" Instead, he wrote the two most famous papers when he was employed as a patent  clerk. After their publication, there was not a major university in the world that would not have been glad to have him on their staff.\nIf you want to work as an artist and you are making a living as a waiter, don't think of yourself as a waiter who hopes one day to become an artist. That puts the work you love somewhere off in the distant future. Rather, think of yourself as an artist, supporting yourself by waiter tables--and paint, or draw as much as you can. It is possible to earn a living wage as a waiter working 24 hours a week. That leaves plenty of time to devote to training or developing your craft in the off hours.\nWhile seeking the work you love, it helps to expand your awareness  into the universe of all possibilities. You don't want to be limited to the ideas of what you should do or what you have done before. Having opened to all possibilities, you can make a final decision and select the work you love as your own.\nDoing the work you love requires that you be equally comfortable with the imaginative and the practical. It requires the ability to dream big dreams and the ability to face and master all the little details that make dreams come true.\n\nQuestion:\nAccording to the passage, the author encourages us to   _  .\n\nChoices:A) start work quickly\nB) select job carefully and patiently\nC) dream often\nD) make up our minds quickly",

Going back to the kitchen I thought about her tired eyes. I offered her a free pancake breakfast. She asked to borrow the money for bus and promised to return and pay me back. I handed over tip money from my pocket. She smiled on her way out the front door.\nThree weeks later she returned my two dollars. She had gotten a job and a friend's bed to sleep on. She offered to buy me breakfast on my break!\nThis kind of thing gets me wondering if something as simple as a breakfast can bring about a small change in society, then why not take it even further and see if one act of friendliness can start to make peace? I believe it can. Peace begins with one person but spreads. When I connect with my neighbors, they return it in kind.\nSo I believe in friendliness and an open ear. For me, it starts with making eye contact when I pour coffee and ask my customers, \"How are you doing?\" and then listen to their answer. My job is to take care of customers, but I also believe we're to take care of each other.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat do we know about the woman who borrowed money from the author?\n\nChoices:A) She had not a friend.\nB) She found a perfect job later.\nC) She didn't have her own home.\nD) She often borrowed money from others.",

Exactly one of the choices is correct.\n\nPassage:\nIt is known to us that computer users are being warned by industry experts to pay attention to secret codes which could be used to record their conversation.\nE-mails, screen savers, and electronic greeting cards can carry a secret code which is able to turn on the computer's microphone, make a recording, and forward it to someone else without the user's knowledge.\nIn fact any attachments   sent to a computer, whether it is a game of Space Invaders, or a moving picture, can possibly be used to spy  .\nExperts say people should always think twice about opening attachments because --- although not common --- bugging   by computer can and has been done.\nBill Lyons, head of the Internet Security Company Finjan, said, \"People in the army have tested this and you can be sure, if people in general are aware of it, then computer hackers   are aware of it. The frightening thing is that there are tools on the Internet which people, using a simple search method, can find, and which will enable them to attach this dangerous code to simple attachments.\"\n\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is TRUE according to the passage?\n\nChoices:A) A moving picture cannot be used to spy.\nB) Electronic greeting cards cannot carry a secret code.\nC) A secret code is used to destroy the computer system.\nD) Any attachments sent to a computer may carry a secret code.",

The entire content of your response should be of the following format: 'ANSWER: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of A,B,C,D.\n\nYou are provided with a passage, a question based on the passage, and four choices for the answer. Exactly one of the choices is correct.\n\nPassage:\nMan, a land animal. But he is also closely tied to the sea. Throughout history the sea has served the needs of man. The sea has provided man with food and a convenient way to travel to many parts of the world. Today, nearly two-thirds of the world's population live within 80 kilometers of the sea coast.\nIn the modern technological world, the sea offers many resources to help mankind survive. Resources on land are beginning to be used up. The sea, however, still can be hoped to supply many of man's needs.\nThe list of riches of the sea yet to be developed by man's technology is big. Oil and gas explorations have been carried out for nearly 30 years. Valuable amounts of minerals exist on the ocean floor ready to be mined.\nFish farming promises to be a good way to produce large quantities of food. The culture of fish and shellfish   is an ancient skill practised in the past mainly by _ , including people in China.\nBesides oil and gas, the sea may offer new sources of energy. Experts believe that the warm temperature of the ocean can be used in a way similar to the steam in a steamship. Ocean currents and waves offer possible use as a source of energy.\nTechnology is enabling man to explore ever more deeply under the sea. The development of strong, new materials has made this possible.\nThe technology to harvest the sea continues to improve. Experts believe that by the year 2020 the problems that prevent us from exploiting  fully the food, minerals, and energy sources of the sea will be largely solved.\n\nQuestion:\nThe best title for this passage is   _  .\n\nChoices:A) Sea Harvest\nB) Sea Food\nC) Technology for Exploiting the Sea\nD) Man and the Sea",

The new development- liquid wood- can replace plastics in all branches of modern-day industries.\nPlastic as a material enjoys the biggest demand in the modern world, but it does have a number of drawbacks. First and foremost, plastic isn't recyclable. Secondly, it contains toxins   helping develop cancerous diseases. Finally, it's made of oil and oil reserves aren't endless.\nThe liquid wood technology is likely to replace plastic and providing mankind with new materials for many years ahead. Norbert Eisenfreich, a senior researcher at the Faunhofer Institute for Chemical Technology in Germany (ICT), said that arboform, the new material, is made of lignin , which can be obtained from soft tissues of wood. Once mixed with several other matenals, it turns into solid and non-toxic _ for plastics.\nICT team leader Emilia Regina Inone-Kauffmann said the wood-working industry separates wood into three basic components, including lignin. Lignin isn't used for the production of paper. Specialists of ICT mixed lignin with several natural materials and thus invented the material which could be melted and molded  .\nWhen solid, arboform looks like plastic and possesses tho qualitie of polished wood. It can be used for the production of any items. Arboform is already used for the production of car parts which require extra strength. In addition, liquid wood can be recycled repeatedly. The material preserved all of its qualities even if it's reprocessed ten times.\nHowever, the new invention doesn't enjoy an extensive use due to the high content of sulfur  in it. German researchers are sure to reduce the amount of sulfur by 90% very soon to make arboform usable for home needs.\n\nQuestion:\nAccording to the passage, plastic  _  .",

He built up over 80 companies in 20 different countries.\nHe was always searching for a meaning to life. He spent much time and money working on how to end the wars, and the peace between nations, until his death in Italy in 1896. His famous last will, in which he left money to provide prizes for outstanding work in physics, chemistry, physiology, medicine, literature and peace, is a memorial to his interests and ideas. And so, the man is remembered and respected long after his death.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat was Alfred Nobel always searching for?\n\nChoices:A) More time and more money.\nB) A meaning to life.\nC) How to end the war.\nD) The peace between nations.",

Exactly one of the choices is correct.\n\nPassage:\nTIJUANA, Mexico - A powerful earthquake swayed   buildings from Los Angeles to Tijuana, killing two people in Mexico, blacking out cities and forcing the evacuation   of hospitals and nursing homes. One California city closed off its downtown due to unstable buildings.\nThe 7.2-magnitude quake centered just south of the US border near Mexicali was one of the strongest earthquakes to hit the region in decades.\n\"It sounds like it's felt by at least 20 million people,\" USGS seismologist Lucy Jones said. \"Most of Southern California felt this earthquake.\"\nSunday afternoon's earthquake hit hardest in Mexicali, a commerce center along Mexico's border with California, where authorities said the quake was followed by at least 20 smaller aftershocks, including ones of magnitudes 5.1, 4.5 and 4.3.\n\"It has not stopped trembling in Mexicali,\" said Baja California state Civil Protection Director Alfredo Escobedo on Monday.\nEscobedo said one man was killed when his home collapsed just outside of Mexicali and another died when he rushed into the street in panic and was struck by a car. At least 100 people were injured in the city, most of them struck by falling objects. Power was out in virtually the entire city.\nSusan Warmbier was putting away groceries in the San Diego suburb of Chula Vista when her husband asked, \"Is the house moving?\"\nElsewhere in San Diego, there were reports of shattered windows, broken pipes and water main breaks in private buildings, but no reports of injuries, San Diego Fire-Rescue Department spokesman Maurice Luque said. Coronado Bridge over San Diego Bay was briefly closed as a precaution.\nAcross the border in Tijuana, Mexico, the quake caused buildings to sway and knocked out power in some areas. No tsunami warning was issued, but hundreds of people on Tijuana's crowded beach feared the worst and fled when they felt the ground shake.\n\nQuestion:\nCoronado Bridge over San Diego Bay was briefly closed    _    .\n\nChoices:A) to avoid further dangers\nB) by the San Diego Fire-Rescue Department\nC) as a reminding of the quake\nD) to prevent the bridge from destroying",

Here is what life could be like.\nFirst of all, transport should be much better. At present, our spaceships are too slow to carry large numbers of people to Mars -- it takes months. However, by 2100, spaceship can travel at half the speed of light. It might take us two or three days to get to Mars!\nSecondly, humans need food, water and air to live. Scientists should be able to develop plants that can be grown on Mars. These plants will produce the food and air that we need. However, can these plants produce water for us ? There is no answer now.\nThere is a problem for us to live on Mars. Mars pulls us much less than the Earth does. This will be dangerous because we could easily jump too high and fly slowly away into space. To prevent this, humans on Mars have to wear special shoes to make themselves heavier.\nLife on Mars will be better than that on Earth in many ways, People will have more space. Living in a large building with only 10 bedrooms is highly possible. Many people believe that robot will do most of our work, so we have more time for our hobbies.\nThere will probably be no school on Mars. Every student will have a computer at home which is connected to the internet. They can study, do their homework and take exams in online schools. Each student will also have their own online teacher called \"e-teacher\".\nHowever, in some ways, life on Mars may not be better than that on the earth today. Food will not be the same -- meals will probably be in the form of pills and will not be as delicious as they are today, Also, space travel will make many people feel ill. The spaceship will travel fast but the journey to Mars will probably be very uncomfortable.\n\nQuestion:\nSo far, how long will it take us from the earth to Mars by spaceship ?\n\nChoices:A) Two or three days\nB) A few years\nC) A few days\nD) A few months",

In fact,what exists in America is more often a kind of \"side-by-side'' living in which groups of people from other countries often have kept many of their customs and habits. They join the general American society only in certain areas of their lives--such as in schools,business,and sports-but they keep many of their own native customs and manners socially and at home.This living \"side-by-side\"has both advantages and disadvantages.Sometimes it may cause disagreements to develop between  groups whose ways of life are very different from one another.However, there are also great advantages that come from the variety of cultures brought by settlers from other lands.There is great freedom of choice among ideas and dress,food,and social customs in America.Everyone can find some part of his or her familiar world in the United States, in Churches,music,food,national groups,or newspapers.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following statements is true?\n\nChoices:A) They always stick to their own customs and habits.\nB) \"Side--by--side''living style is not suitable.\nC) They face the society they are not familiar with.\nD) The advantages coming from the variety of cultures make life in America color1ful.",

Exactly one of the choices is correct.\n\nPassage:\nThis sense of total discomfort that you're both feeling is pretty normal. And I don't say that to in any way reduce your problems. I just don't want you to think that you're the one person in the world who's stuck with a neurotic   mom. Think about it: for most of the past 14 years, you have depended on your mother for every little thing you've ever needed. Now suddenly you're putting up all sorts of boundaries because you're growing out of being that little kid who needed her for everything, and it's hurting her feelings. What we need here is a little understanding and some new rules to take into account the changes you're going through. You can't just stop sharing things with your mom. It's mean. \nSo why not make a point of telling her some things about what's going on with you every day? She wants to feel that she's still a part of your life. And after consistently doing this for about a month, why don't you tell her where you'd like a little privacy  -- maybe there are certain things you don't want her to always ask about? Promise her that whenever there's an update on those topics, you will completely let her know. And follow up on it!\nThe bottom line is that you guys need to build a new relationship based on the young woman. The only way to do this is to work through some really uncomfortable moments and big fights and then come up with a solution, which is what you're doing now. So don't worry -- it's all going to be okay. But it will take some work, honesty and communication to get there. \nHaving a good relationship with your mom is a really important thing. She's the one person who will always be on your side.\n\nQuestion:\nThe best way to reduce the problems with Mom may probably be   _  .\n\nChoices:A) to communicate with her\nB) to let out your secrets to her\nC) to break your bottom line\nD) to work through bad times",

And indeed,  cutting fat  to control or lose weight makes sense. Fat has nine calories per gram. Protein and carbohydrates  have just four. Moreover, the body uses fewer calories to metabolize fat than it does to metabolize other foods. Compared with protein and carbohydrates -- which break down into amino acids and simple sugars, respectively, and can be used to strengthen and energize the body ---- dietary fat is more easily converted to body fat. Therefore, it's more likely to stay on buttocks, thighs and bellies.\nBut cutting fat from your diet doesn't necessarily mean your body won't store fat. For example, between nonfat and regular cookies, there's trivial difference in calories because manufacturers make up for the loss of fat by adding sugar. Low-fat crackers, soups and dressings can also be just as high in calories as richer versions. No matter where the calories come from, overeating will still cause weight again. The calories from fat just do it a little quicker. A Wisconsin computer programmer who decided with a diet coach to eat only 40 grams of fat a day learned the lesson firsthand.

      "input": "Even as Americans have been gaining weight, they have cut their average fat intake from 36 to 34 percent of their total diets in the past 15 years.  And indeed,  cutting fat  to control or lose weight makes sense. Fat has nine calories per gram. Protein and carbohydrates  have just four. Moreover, the body uses fewer calories to metabolize fat than it does to metabolize other foods. Compared with protein and carbohydrates -- which break down into amino acids and simple sugars, respectively, and can be used to strengthen and energize the body ---- dietary fat is more easily converted to body fat. Therefore, it's more likely to stay on buttocks, thighs and bellies.\nBut cutting fat from your diet doesn't necessarily mean your body won't store fat. For example, between nonfat and regular cookies, there's trivial difference in calories because manufacturers make up for the loss of fat by adding sugar. Low-fat crackers, soups and dressings can also be just as high in calories as richer versions. No matter where the calories come from, overeating will still cause weight again. The calories from fat just do it a little quicker. A Wisconsin computer programmer who decided with a diet coach to eat only 40 grams of fat a day learned the lesson firsthand. He wasn't losing weight. Then he showed his food diary to his coach and revealed he'd been eating half a pound of jelly beans a day. \"They don't have any fat,\" he explains. But they had enough sugar to keep him from shedding an ounce. \nNonfat foods become add-on foods. When we add them to our diet, we actually increase the number of calories we eat per day and gain weight. That was borne out in a Pennsylvania State University study. For breakfast, Prof. Barbara Rolls gave two groups of women yogurt that contained exactly the same amount of calories. One group's yogurt label said \"high fat\"--the other, \"low fat.\" The \"low fat\" yogurt group ate significantly more calories later in the day than the other group. \"People think they've saved fat and can indulge themselves later in the day with no adverse consequences,\" says Richard Mattes, a nutrition researcher at Purdue University. \"But when they do that, they don't compensate very precisely, and they often end up overdoing it.\"\n\nQuestion:\nWhat can you infer from the text ?",

      "input": "An idea that started in Seattle's public library has spread throughout America and beyond.The concept is simple: help to build a sense of community in a city by getting everyone to read the same book at the same time.\nIn addition to encouraging reading as a pursuit   to be enjoyed by all, the program allows strangers to communicate by discussing the book on the bus, as well as promoting reading as an experience to be shared in families and schools.The idea came from Seattle librarian Nancy Pearl who launched  the \"If All of Seattle Read the Same Book \" project in 1998.Her original program used author visits, study guides and book discussion groups to bring people together with a book, but the idea has since expanded to many other American cities, and even to Hong Kong.\nIn Chicago, the mayor appeared on television to announce the choice of To Kill a Mockingbird as the first book in the \"One Book, One Chicago\" program.As a result, reading clubs and neighborhood groups sprang up around the city.Across the US, stories emerged of parents and children reading to each other at night and strangers chatting away on the bus about plot and character.\nThe only problem arose in New York, where local readers could not decide on one book to represent the huge and diverse population. This may show that the idea works best in medium-sized cities or large towns, where a greater sense of unity can be achieved. Or it may show that New Yorkers rather missed the point, putting all their energy and passion into the choice of the book rather than discussion about a book itself.\nUltinatelas Nancy points out, the level of success is not measured by how many people read a book, but by how many people are enriched by the process, or have enjoyed speaking to someone with whom they would not otherwise have shared a word.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the purpose of the project launched by Nancy?",
